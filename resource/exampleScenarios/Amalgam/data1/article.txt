Less response time, but more overhead in maintaining multiple copies. To reduce overhead, allow copies to diverge in a controlled fashion - notion of quasi copies and quasi-caching. - users can precisely define limits for divergence of quasi-copies. - reduces update propagation overhead - main difference with materialized views is that here user can establish    degree of coherency - implementation possibilities: invalidate/refresh out-of-date data, include   automatic expiration date etc.   Paper surveys various implementation   strategies and their tradeoffs. users give two types of conditions on quasi-caches: selection and coherency. - selection conditions specify which object images will be cached at the   user site.   - modifiers:      - Add/drop (add to cache or remove)     - compulsory or advisory (whether caching is to be enforced or to be       taken as a hint)       - query optimizer can take advantage if caching is compulsory       - advisory selection gives greater system flexibility     - static / dynamic ( static objects selected once when the condition       is issued by a user, dynamic => changes in data cause objects to be - triggering delay: specifies acceptable delay for dynamic selections - coherency conditions define the allowable deviations between an object and   its images.     - default: image must have a valid value (though out-of-date)   - delay: how much time an image may lag behind an object   - version: acceptable lag of how many versions    - periodic: image to be refreshed periodically   - arithmetic: deviations limited by the difference between the values of     the object and its image.    - can also have inter-object consistency constraints. implementation issues - transmission delays and failures: null messages sent out by central site    to check if client is alive etc. - what to propagate:   - data message: contains new values to overwrite old ones in cache   - invalidation message: only identifies invalid object to be purged from     the cache, but does not contain new values.    - version number message: provides new version numbers only - no new data   - implicit invalidation: no message from central site, cache images     automatically invalidated after a certain time. - when to propagate:     - last minute: delayed until a selection/coherency condition is about to be                  violated.    - immediately: as soon as updates occur   - delayed update at central site, so no cache conditions are violated. - collapsing conditions:   - possible to collapse several coherency conditions on same object into one - load balancing: central site can partially off-load enforcement of   consistency to clients describes a probabilistic performance model and simulation results - simulation parameters are network traffic, query processing time, update   installation time etc.  conclusions: - quasi-caching can potetially improve performance and availability - problems if:   - selection and consistency constraints are complex   - large number of updates at central site - open issues:   - how much data to cache   - how does choice of when to propagate updates affect performance  etc.

To examine the effect of mass storage performance on interpretation overhead, our performunce model includes parameters which describe the CPU and the mass storage system being studied.  We next analyze these experiments and describe our conclusion that schema interpretation is a  significant portion of system overhead.  A second source of overhead involving contention for schema descriptor buffer space is then  discussed. In a coded system B locality of D, B references are required.

No new concepts in technology. perhaps a nice integration of existing concepts in a working product. The product is based on an extensive natural language research and development effort which started in 1983 as part of ESPIRIT project, and has been available since the summer of 1990. Recognizing the difficulty of porting and fine-tuning a natural language interface to a new database, the system is not proposed as an off-the-shelf product, but as a technological basis (which must be complemented by specific customizing work performed by a team of specialist).   The authors state that the off-the-shelf approach of selling natural language interfaces with porting tools is probably one of the reasons why natural language interface systems have not been used widely as they should. Its features include: - Implementation in BIM Prolog (35K lines of code) - Connection to relational DBMS (Sybase, Oracle, Ingres, ..) at the   tuple level, namely, bypassing the SQL interface. - Top-down layered processing architecture (as in SRI's TEAM). - Grammar formalism based on Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar. - A postquery cooperative response module. ---Cha.

Frames repesenting PROTOTYPE concept (such as TYPICAL mammal), as opposed to definitional concept, allos representation of exceptions by  cancellation of attributes and/or overriding of default attribute values in inheritance mechanism.    However, with this prototype capability alone, we cannot express exceptionless universally quantified statements like `Every Four_Legged_Mammal has the attribute 'Number_of_legs' and its  value of 4', since the attribute 'Number_of_legs' can be cancelled(disappear) or the value of 4 be overridden in more specialized frames down  from the frame Four_Legged_Mammal. To augment the prototype representation  capability with definitional one, we should be able to declare SACREDNESS  (as opposed to cancellable or overridable) on  attribute and/or its value.   Four types of slots are conceivable according to the degree of sacredness : I. Sacred attribute and sacred attribute value   (to express `Every Four_Legged_Mammal has the attribute 'Number_Of_Legs'    and its value of 4') II. Sacred attribute and overridable default value   (Once the attribute in parent frame is inherited to child frame    without cancellation, the value specified in the parent frame should    be inherited, too.)   IV. Cancellable attribute and overridable default value. Recognition of different types of slot gives the different degree of belief by interpreter. Inheritance Constraint :  In inheriting attribute from parent frame to child  frame, cancellable attribute may be inherited cancellable or converted to  sacred attribute.  The same for inheritance of the attribute value: The  overridable default value may be inherited as overridable default value or  converted to sacred value.  However, the sacred attribute or attribute  value should be inherited sacred in child frame. In addition to giving the  different degrees of belief in interpretation, recognition of different  types of slots and imposing inheritance constraint also helps the process of  structuring and maintenance of knowledge easier. ++

Other assumptions of the model include: 1) all I/O requests are statistically identical; 2) the dependence of the seek   time on the number of I/O requests is not taken into consideration; 3) those I/O requests which find the I/O path busy are not expected to be reissued by the CPU; 4) after a reconnection is established, the time spent for searching the data-identifier key is treated as part of the transfer time; and 5) in the normal cases the transfer times are represented by random variables with an exponential distribution.

The approach is to use a loading mechanism which retrieves  information from the secondary storage database and stores it in the main  memory in a concise form, which can be used by the Prolog interpreter.   The loading mechanism works in two ways.  First, prior to the execution of  the Prolog program, the loading mechanism determines those predicates  which correspond to small relations and retrieves all the data of the relations into main memory.  Second, during execution, the loading mechanism interacts with the main memory database to determine whether the access to data in the secondary storage is unavoidable, and performs queries on the secondary storage database only in that case.  For this  purpose,a 'tracer' is needed to keep track of the instances of database  facts fetched into the main memory. Although the loading mechanism was implemented in the Prolog environment, the ideas of the approach are also applicable to the LISP environment. The implementation was partially  completed. ---BYLee

For uniprocessor systems -- the assumption of a uniform dist.is optimistic when: 1. hashing--fewer collisions, shorter lists at collisions should be expected from a uniform distribution. 2. trees--more balancing costs may be incurred for non-uniform distributions. 3. searching--for example, a binary search on a non-uniform could cost significantly more. 4. sorting--I suspect that uniform distributions are optimal for some sorting methods, although I haven't looked at this in any detail. ---B.Thompson.

Free mass storage  will free database systems from the limitations and problems caused by  conventional deletion techniques.  A non-deletion strategy is described that would significantly simplify database systems and their operation, as well as increase their functionality and availability.  This limiting case helps shed light on a more realistic argument:  if the cost of mass storage were  low enough, then deletion would become undesirable.

Intention to update from phase 2 is withdrawn if abort or restart is the  end result of phase 2.  Two versions are presented, either the data are  transmitted in phase 3, or, if handled as phase 2 of two-phase commit  protocol, the data are held in secure storage from phase 2 to phase 3. In case of partitioning, voting (ref. Gifford) is used, but to prevent broad lockouts, those transactions which cannot update all copies must post this failure at a quorum of nodes, so that successor transactions can test that they do not conflict, and do not enter phase 3.  Dangling precommits may be resolved by checking other nodes in the partition. On restablishing the net acyclicness is created by possibly restarting transactions which led to a cycle in the combined schedule.

The primary difference is that it requires all of a transaction's updates to be written to the log in contiguous log pages, which allows some compact encodings to be used in representing the log, but also means that more work must be done synchronously at commit time.  Also, their scheme is not designed to support two-phase commit, and extending it to handle two-phase commit is sure to mess up the pretty log encoding, I think. ---Mark Brown.

However, for applications requiring access to the global state, a total ordering is inappropriate.  This paper presents algorithms for timestamping events in both synchronous and asynchronous message-passing programs that allow for access to the partial ordering inherent in a parallel system.  The algorithms do not change the communications graph or require a central timestamp issuing authority.

Although not fully relational(no  views, ..), it has some interesting features, not only of its easy-to-create menu-oriented user interfaces, but also of its supporting DB model. Database access is soley by menu-interaction without introducing a linear query language like SQL.   Its user model in general is based on a single  record entry and single and multiple record view.    Join operation can be done on the fly along predefined (at the database definition time) connections between files.  Two types of connections are supported and they are the structural Model's reference and ownership connections in disguise: - Can declare one of two files as linking(referencing) file and another as linked(referenced) file.   For instance, entering a new value of dept code in Employee relation pops up a window for entering a new tuple in Dept relation. - Can define a nested relation by creating a subfile to a parent file. It seems that a subfile is accessible through its parent file. ---S.Cha.

No remote update and local  versioning avoids cache locks.

Binding between file names and data objects is variable, so that the user name for the file remains the same, but is rebound to the new data object. If no more user names refer to the object, the space is reused. Given sufficient local storage, we now believe it is unnecessary in this application to have shared file servers that provide mutable files, block-at-a-time access to files, long-term locks, or transactions. ---Feustel.

One of the papers usually referred to when discussing semantic data models. Describes a model which permits a lot of flexibility and ecpressiveness, and is consequently difficult to implement. Advantage is that it can be used as a specification and documentation tool. Good introduction, giving an overview of (some?, most?, all?) problems in semantic data models. The section describing SDM DDL is a bit too detailed (one needs to pick up the essential concepts like subclassing, and redundancy in model (which may be necessary to make the model easier to use). Some discussion of inheritance is also present. Nothing much is said in the final discussion.  Reasonable paper. To benefit, one needs to be careful not to get lost in the details. A detailed description of the semantic data model.---  Arun

The program combines formal protocol guidelines with judgments of oncologists who have experience adjusting therapy in complex clinical situations. We compared the chemotherapy administered by clinic physicians with the treatment that would have been recommended by ONCOCIN in 415 visits for 39 lymphoma patients seen prior to the program's introduction. In 189 visits, the computer agreed with the therapy actually administered. In a blinded evaluation, 4 lymphoma experts failed to find a significant difference between the treatments selected by physicians and those proposed by ONCOCIN. Subanalyses showed that ONCOCIN tended to attenuate drug doses or delay treatment more than the experts recommended, whereas the physicians were less likely to attenuate doses to the extent the experts suggested.  Our results show that ONCOCIN provides lymphoma treatment advice comparable to the treatment provided in a  university oncology clinic.

The time-segment is an interval if it  has at least two subsegments (intuitively similar to end-points). Otherwise, it is a time-point. The rest of the development is very much like interval algebra of Allen. The paper also introduces the following relationships: ``wholistic'', ``homogeneous''and ``occassional''. An action is wholistic if it holds over the time-segment (similar to relationship between an object  and a set). It is homogeneous if it holds over all sub-segments and  occassional if some sub-segments are left out.  The presentation is nice and clear, but its overall contribtion is not really significant. ---surajit

1593|Kent1985|Improvements in Data Collection Through Physician Use of a Computer-Based Chemotherapy Treatment Consultant|Journal of Clinical Oncology.|1985||1409--1417|3|||> DBDquery> MCS>||The impact of a computer-based data management system on the completeness of clinical trial data was studied before and after the system's introduction in an oncology clinic. Physicians use the system, termed ONCOCIN, to record data during patient visits and receive advice about treatment and tests required by experimental cancer protocols. Although ONCOCIN does not force the user to enter all data expected by the protocol, after its introduction there was improvement in the recording frequency of such data.  The percentage of  expected physical findings recorded increased from 74 to 91pct (p<.05),  toxicity history from <1 to 45pct (p<.01), general chemistry results from 36  to 82pct (p<.01), x-ray results from 44 to 73pct (p<.01) and physicians'  assessments of overall disease activity and Karnofsky performance status  from 73 to 91pct (p<.05).  Analysis of the steps in data collection and  their contribution to loss of data suggests that observations or test  ordering which are dependent on the physician are most improved by the  system.  Furthermore, analysis of post-ONCOCIN visits when the system was  unavailable suggests that recording of physician-dependent data (physical findings and assessments of disease activity and performance status) is  likely to revert to pre-ONCOCIN levels if the system is not used routinely.  The results show that ONCOCIN can greatly enhance recovery of those data  expected for chemotherapy protocol patients. The program's interaction with  the physician is central to its effectiveness in data collection, especially for  data that arise directly from the patient-physician encounter.

1680|Kolata1981|Students Discover Computer Threat|Science, 5.|1981|March|1216--1217|215|||> DBDprivacy>||The discovery of a simple but powerful way to break into computer systems  poses a problem:  who should be told of the threat and how.  A way for a  person who is legitimately logged onto one terminal in a time-sharing  computer system to trick the computer into thinking he is another user  logged in at a different terminal.  He would thereby gain access to all the  privileges of the user he impersonates, such as access to the second user's  files, the ability to modify or delete information from those files, and the  ability to execute the other user's programs.  An otherwise innocuous  feature of many computer systems, the ability to determine who is logged in at a particular time, is necessary for this method to succeed.

A BCNF covering is sometimes unattainable, i.e., some sets of FDs have no corresponding BCNF schema.  It is difficult to determine whether a given schema in BCNF is NP-complete. In practice, however, the theoretical objections are minor, and BCNF remains the most practical basis for database design.

It differs from current systems in that it  allows the simultaneous search of several bibliographic databases.   The databases may be on different sites and may use different query  languages (MISTRAL, QUEST, ....). These local languages are invisible to the users of MESSIDOR.  They are all translated to a single language.  We describe MESSIDOR's goals, system architecture, user language and some details of the implementation.  The system is implemented on a MICRAL 80-30 microcomputer.

System seems to be a much more powerful query language the ones commercially available today.  It adds the power and dexterity of Prolog-like logic to standard query techniques.  The NAIL! System exhibits  a tendency to swing the database community from object-oriented query  languages back to value-oriented query languages. There seemed to be  ambiguity as to how to handle recursive rules.  The paper gave some  techniques but didn't prefer one over the other.  Overall, the NAIL! System appears to be a superior attempt at strengthening conventional database query operations. ---Avery

Makes a comparison between FRL and the newer object-oriented  languages Flavors, PMFS, and LOOPS. Shows that simulation of the features of FRL in Flavors presents some difficulties. The major differences between FRL and the later object-oriented languages are: (1) FRL is data-oriented, procedure execution is only a side-effect whereas in object-oriented languages message passing is central. (2) FRL does not make a very strict distinction between individual and generic objects, object-oriented languages do, so that dynamic changes are more problematic in object-oriented languages. --- Waqar

The cache consistency mechanism permits files to be shared by multiple clients without danger of stale data. The file system of each machine  negotiates with the virtual memory system over physical memory usage and  changes the size of the file cache dynamically. Benchmarks indicate that client caches allow diskless workstations to  perform within 0-12% of workstations with disks. Client caching reduces server loading by 50pct and network traffic by 90pct. Policies that require dirty data to be written through the client's cache  to the server's disk result in serious performance degradation. /  Conclusions: 1) A client can access data in its own cache 6-8 times faster than in a server's cache. 2) Clients can access a server's cache at about the same speed as a local disk. ---Huber.

The rapid growth of  the field of computational complexity has greatly increased our ability to  analyze algorithms. And perhaps most significantly, we have finally started  to make real progress in developing principles and theories for the design  and verification of algorithms and programs.  Are these changes evident in  Curriculum '78?  Sadly No. That curriculum only lends support to the  equation Computer Science equals Programing that is mistakenly believed by  so many outside the discipline.

By doubling the disk space for the database, UNDO logging can be performed with a minimum of additional I/O operations.  We gain a performance comparable to systems without any UNDO  logging.  This TWIST algorithm uses one logical slot of two physical blocks. /  Rapid logging to disk of after-images into alternate blocks, preserving the before-image.  On reading both adjoining blocks are read and the latest copy is used.  Undo resets transaction numbers of blocks written by transactions being undone.

This note is to announce the (near) availability of a deductive database system suitable for dealing with very large databases of Prolog rules.  The indexing scheme used by the system is based on the method of two-level superimposed codewords as described here, which allows partial match retrieval.  Superimposed codeword schemes provide a very efficient method of retrieving records from large databases in only a small number of disk accesses.  Further, the access method can be tuned so that the ratio of `false matches' can be reduced by an arbitrary amount (with a corresponding increase in storage costs). Unlike many earlier systems, this system supports the storage and retrieval of completely general Prolog terms, including functors and variables, and it is even possible to store Prolog rules in the database.  The system is in the final stages of development under Berkeley Unix (4.2BSD) and has already been interfaced to the MU-Prolog system, soon for Unix and VMS on a Pyramid 90x. Test using a UNET path database of one million facts, which have an average length of  60 bytes, required just over 80Mb, which means a storage overhead of about  30pct.  Indexed on three attributes, the rate of insertion is six records  per CPU second with locking controls. Specifying just two of the fields (each record contains four fields), retrieved on average just 3 records for a query which had only one correct answer.  The system can achieve a record retrieval rate of around 1000 records per second for a query on highly clustered records,  to about 50 records per second for a query on unclustered records. A query with complete information, required on average 1.1 retrievals, and required 4 disk accesses (excluding overheads from the Unix file system).  This system overcomes some of the limitations of the Unix file system.  For example, it overcomes the limit of twenty open files per process by caching on Unix file descriptors, thus allowing several database relations to be accessed simultaneously.  The system also provides data buffering to reduce the number of file opens and data reads.  The processing time of logic programs such as the 'ancestor' relation can be minimised by this feature.  This system eliminates a number of restrictions which were associated with the deductive database system provided with release 3.1 of MU-Prolog.  That system implemented the database manager as a separate process from the Prolog interpreter, communicating via Unix pipes.  The present system is designed as a library package which is compiled into the host system; it could be incorporated fairly easily into most Prolog interpreters, or, in fact, into any systems that wished to perform partial match retrieval. The use of pipes in the old MU-Prolog system placed severe limitations (because of Unix file descriptor limitations) on the number of transactions (queries) which could be active concurrently; the new system has eliminated this restriction. Finally, this system lifts the restriction that only ground facts could be stored in the database, by allowing the storage of arbitrary Prolog terms (including rules).

Exhibits uniformity in that both entities and their relationships are described in terms of functions (which can be single- or multi-valued). Allows subtype/supertype relationships among entity types, but only one supertype allowed. Derived functions are quite important. They are the basis for user views. A suggested application is as a frontend to a DBMS based on other data models, since it allows representation of more semantics.  Easy paper to read. Has some nice ideas which could be profitably  incorporated in other data models. --- Arun

Each transformation is assessed on three features:  1) information preservation (data are not destroyed, only their logical format is altered); 2) data dependence (a data   dependent transformation is one in which the stored DB must be checked to determine whether it is consistent with the logical format of the target system); and 3) program dependence (a program dependent transformation is one in which the application programs must be checked to determine whether the transformation is permissible).  At every stage the DB is kept in fourth normal form.  The 15 transformations are divided into five groups.  The first group includes simple alterations, such as changing the name of an attribute or relation (CHANGE NAME), or adding or deleting attributes or relations (ADD/DELETE ATTRIBUTES, INTRODUCE/SEPARATE).  The role played by keys in the relational model is clearly critical, and particular care must be taken when transformations involving these keys are being carried out. The second group of tranformations concerns the effect of adding attributes to or deleting attributes from keys (PROMOTE/DEMOTE).  The third and fourth sets of transformations are provided for the combining and dividing of relations.  (COMPOSE/DECOMPOSE, PARTITION/MERGE). The final group of transformations is concerned with functional dependencies

Number (2) is limited to a fairly specific set of problems (the example they give is the time attribute).  For these cases, the approach is quite reasonable.  I don't think it's especially interesting, though.   Number (1) is more interesting.  The basic idea is to provide a uniform framework for expression of such things as views, protection, and integrity constraints.  Their mechanism is similar to the 'rule-based system' idea from AI, although there are some major differences.  It amounts to an extension of the query modification idea.  But, I don't think this  is really the right mechanism for what they propose.  The rules tend to be procedural rather than declarative.  For integrity constraints (and maybe the other things), the procedural version just isn't as clear.  (The authors admit this during the discussion.)  Maybe the rule-based approach is useful as a method for implementing constraints, etc, rather than a language for  expressing them; this isn't discussed. The rules are useful for expressing certain esoteric update restrictions. (E.g., 'Jones is the only one who is allowed to update this relation between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m.')  But, these sorts of restrictions aren't especially interesting, in that they have nothing to do with the semantics of the database. I'm not sure what the 'breadth' of their method is.   It looks like the rules can only be triggered by updates.  This means that  views, for example, cannot be implemented this way, because queries are not  affected by the rules.  I can't tell from the paper whether or not this is in fact the case.  As I say, though, I think the basic idea is interesting; also, they seem to have implemented at least part of it.

Techniques for providing transparencies abstracted and discussed.  By system schedule and system clock a distributed system can be modeled as a single sequential execution sequence. /  This paper is a easy-to-read introduction to required transparency in distributed database systems. 4 transparencies are chosen and explained here, namely location transparency, replication transparency, concurrency transparency, and failure transparency. The transaction model adapted by the paper is fully synchronous and 2 phase protocol is used to implement concurrency transparency. The paper proves that if all transaction executions are two-phase, any legal execution of the transactions by a distributed system will be equivalent to some serial execution of the transactions by a system consisting of a single node under the assumption that updates are synchronous. The paper introduces special node-associated clock to prove it. The paper also gives simple explanation about a protocol to implement failure transparency using logs and two-phase commit protocol. ---Mikasa.

This mapping does not cover lists, structures, and   the Prolog cut operator.  A prototype using this mapping has been   implemented.

However, the major difference between it and RAP.3 is that the latter is a research project while DIALOG exists in paper only.  There are other differences in design.  In RAP.3, for example, each node in the network is equal, whereas in DIALOG, the network is hierarchical:  the host computer communicates with a number of backend controllers, each of which is connected to a cluster of data modules.  Another difference lies in the physical communication link:  while RAP.3 is Ethernet-based DIALOG is a fully-connected network using serial lines governed by a central clock as links.  In addition, the database in RAP.3 is partitioned while that in DIALOG is duplicated.  (Kitty Shih comment)

Uses the nested-loop join with use of indexes. An index is an array of tuple identifiers. Assess uses binary search.  When an index entry is inserted, the upper half of the index is block-copied. In a 3081 processor copying 1 MB of memory takes less than 0.1 second.  Queries in OBE are in the canonical form, have no substructures. Pure demand paging is not suitable, the system has a global goal for paging activities.  The set of virtual machines on the dispatch list is determined.

An AMHS is a more complex program than is generally thought.  It must exhibit the characteristics of a well-designed database system, a user-oriented message processor, an interactive command and control system, and a rapid message handling system.

The point is made, that, as computers get cheaper, smaller and more versatile, managers are demanding their own facilities.  Since this demand can lead to duplication, lack of standards, and generally poor control the author suggests the concept of distributed responsibility by which managers are given responsibility for their own success, with technical experts assigned as needed to their project teams. At the same time, he feels that a top-level steering committee is necessary to approve projects and monitor their progress.  (G. Fountain comment). Motivation for Federated system.

Arithmetic coding dispenses with the restriction that each symbol must translate into an integral number of bits, thereby coding more efficiently.

I'm doubtful that dividing the responsibility for output does much to divide the total work, since in a recursive logic program, you probably get very quickly into common territory, even if you start with the set of goal tuples completely partitioned.  (Think, for example, of a genealogy, where processor 1 is to determine the ancestors of a set of men and processor 2 the ancestors of a set of women.)  However, the subject is  interesting, and some analysis of the idea and its potential would be  excellent. ---jdu.
